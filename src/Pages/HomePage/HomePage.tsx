                        If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we 
                        recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.
                        You can use React without a framework, however weâ€™ve found that most apps and 
                        sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, 
                        data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries,
                        not just React. By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, 
                        and avoid essentially building your own framework later..
